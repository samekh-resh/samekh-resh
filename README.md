<h1>Hi Everyone!!</h1>
<p>My name is Samekh Resh, and I'm a Software Engineer with Resilient Coders and a Filmmaker @ Bold Pursuits Production. I've been a creative all my life; writing and acting for 10+ years of my life. However, software engineering si something fairly fresh to me, and I'm looking to buld my understnading of not only the baseline concepts, but advanced theory and application as well.</p>
<p> In my freetime, I love hiking and knitting. I haven't knitted a full sweater or socks yet, but I do love making a good scarf. Socks are next! I love taking off my shoes, letting my feet hit the bare ground and just existing on the planet like a flower for a bit. Reading is essential and such a good relaxer. Deep diving in water or bivouac in a forest.</p>


<p>  am reachable on twitter, linkedin and github and twitch! Please be patient,as I will be adding them in the near future. I look forward to coding and chatting with you all. </p>
